The program would firstly check if there is any parameter passed from the command line. If not, continue to the user input mode. 
In the user input mode, the program prompts the user to input information in the order of gender, phone number, reasons, and endings. Each input is checked to make sure the value is valid, or the user is asked to input again. Then the user is asked to confirm the input. If not confirmed, the program would loop back to the beginning of the user input section, i.e. prompt for gender choice. By confirming the choices, the user is asked to name a mp3 file for output.
In the command line mode, the program reads in -g -n -r -e -o flags and assign values to corresponding variables. All values are checked before proceeding to the next step. The program would terminate if any value is not valid.
Then the program would make a file list with the naming conventions on http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~chiso/itp125/project_version_1/ folder. Subsequently a text file named output.txt would be generated including gender, phone number, and the file list. Then the required mp3 files are downloaded from the server. The program firstly check the host's operating system, and would combine the mp3 files in order using "copy /b" in Windows or "cat" in Linux or Mac OS. All files excepted the newly generated output mp3 file are removed using "del" in Windows or "rm" in Linux or Mac OS.
